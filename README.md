    EXAMPLE-ADVENTURE

    hello_world

## Why?
Just about everyone knows `express`, but do you know `http`? By exploring the
layer underlying all frameworks you get a powerful tool in your arsenal,
allowing you to quickly create `http` connections by just running
`require('http')`.

This adventure is smaller in scope than [`learnyounode`](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)
which teaches most of the node basics. If you're completely new to Node it's
recommended to start there.

If you're completely new to JavaScript it's recommended you try out
[`javascripting`](http://ghub.io/javascripting).

If you're here to just learn some `http`,  I welcome you traveller!
